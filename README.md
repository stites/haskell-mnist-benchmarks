## Archiving this project
This project is being archived for the time-being since I am working primarily on [hasktorch](https://github.com/hasktorch/hasktorch/) these days. If you are interested in continuing or updating this project (or adding hasktorch examples), feel free to ping @stites in the hasktorch issues.
